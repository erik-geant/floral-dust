# GÃ‰ANT Python packaging exercise

## Discussion

This repository contains a simple python
script (`primes.py`) that prints all primes
less than or equal to a given number.

## Exercises

1. Please add some basic unit tests for the `primes.py` file.
   * Explain (roughly) how to automate execution of all unit tests
     with Jenkins, Travis CI, or some other CI framework.
   * Explain how to integrate testing against multiple Python
     interpreter versions with the CI framework you chose.
   * Propose a branching model for managing changes and releases.
2. Please package this file as a releasable python
   package that can be installed with `pip`and is then
   runnable from the command line as `prime-printer`.
